We are a research group in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.yorku.ca/science/profiles/faculty/kaiqiong-zhao/)
at York University. Our work develops novel statistical, machine learning, and AI methods to address the challenges of high-dimensional biomedical and omics data. 

Current projects include robust data integration, Mendelian randomization, and regional DNA methylation QTL mapping, with applications in genomics, epigenetics, and precision medicine. By connecting methodological innovation with real-world biomedical problems, our research advances both fundamental statistical methodology and impactful health discoveries. 

We warmly welcome interdisciplinary collaborations across statistics, computer science, and the biomedical sciences.

We are actively recruiting motivated PhD students and postdoctoral fellows to join our growing group.
