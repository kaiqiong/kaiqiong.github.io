[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-SOMNiBUS-blue.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#SOMNiBUS)

A method for estimating smooth covariate effects and identifying differentially methylated regions, which copes with experimental errors and provides reliable inference. [Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.13307)

- [sparseSOMNiBUS](https://github.com/kaiqiong/sparseSOMNiBUS), coded with *Rcpp*

A sparse-smooth modeling method for identifying SNPs associated with methylation levels in a region, which copes with high-dimensional feature space and allows variable selection.

- [MoMotif](https://github.com/kaiqiong/MoMotif)

A bioinformatics tool for a sensitive identification, at the single base-pair resolution, of complex, or subtle, alterations to core binding motifs, discerned from ChIP-seq data. [Paper](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/15/8441/6659876?login=false)

## Shiny Application
