## R packages

- [SOMNiBUS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/bioc/html/SOMNiBUS.html)
"[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-/month-green.svg)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/stats/bioc/SOMNiBUS)"

A method for estimating smooth covariate effects and identifying differentially methylated regions, which copes with experimental errors and provides reliable inference. [Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.13307)

- [sparseSOMNiBUS](https://github.com/kaiqiong/sparseSOMNiBUS), coded with *Rcpp*

A sparse-smooth modeling method for identifying SNPs associated with methylation levels in a region, which copes with high-dimensional feature space and allows variable selection.

## Shiny Application

- A web-based **Risk Calculator for Readmission for Dehydration following Creation of a  Diverting Loop Ileostomy**.
